        Hi #{customer.name},

        We are writing to remind you that you have items that you have some past due items.

        #{not_past_due_item_info}

        Please return the past due items as soon as possible and any items you're not currently using.

        Thank you,

      Additionally, you have other checkouts that are still out but are not yet past due:

      #{checkouts_list(not_past_due_checkouts)}
    NOT_PAST_DUE
  end

  def checkouts_list(checkouts)
